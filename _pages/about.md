I am a Junior Research Group Leader at the [Institute of Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research](https://ibima.med.uni-rostock.de/) at the University Medical Center Rostock, Germany.

## Research Focus

My research applies computational and statistical methods to address fundamental questions in biology and medicine, with emphasis on:

* **Microbial Bioinformatics and Microbiome Research** - investigating host-microbe interactions, bacterial pathogenesis, and population-level infection dynamics, particularly focused on Staphylococcus infections across Northern European populations
* **Single-cell Genomics and Transcriptomics** - developing analytical approaches to understand cellular heterogeneity in aging, inflammation, and senescence processes
* **Aging Research and Longevity** - applying bioinformatics methods to identify molecular mechanisms underlying aging and age-related diseases
* **Cell Differentiation Mechanisms** - computational modeling of molecular mechanisms governing cell differentiation in protists and higher organisms
* **Immunology and Host Response** - analyzing immune cell populations, particularly MAIT cells, in bacterial infections and inflammatory responses

My work bridges experimental biology with computational analysis, developing and applying bioinformatics pipelines for high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic, and metagenomic data.
