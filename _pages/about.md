I am a Junior Research Group Leader at the [Institute of Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research](https://ibima.med.uni-rostock.de/) at the University Medical Center Rostock, Germany.

My research focuses on translational bioinformatics, applying computational and statistical methods to understand biological and medical data. I work at the intersection of biostatistics, medical informatics, and genomics to develop analytical approaches for high-throughput molecular technologies.
