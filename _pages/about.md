We are the Research Group Translational Bioinformatics at the [Institute of Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research (IBIMA)](https://ibima.med.uni-rostock.de/), [Universitätsmedizin Rostock](https://www.med.uni-rostock.de/), Germany.

## Research Focus

Our work bridges experimental biology with computational analysis, developing and applying bioinformatics pipelines for high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic, microbiome and metagenomic data, especially in the contexts of aging and infection research.

<!--

### Main Research Areas

* High-throughput genomic and transcriptomic data analysis
* Microbiome and metagenomic data analyses and interventions
* Microbial genomics and bioinformatics
* Computational drug repositioning
* Aging Research and Longevity


* **Cell Differentiation Mechanisms** - We use computational modeling to understand molecular mechanisms governing cell differentiation in protists and higher organisms

* **Immunology and Host Response** - We analyze immune cell populations, particularly MAIT cells, in bacterial infections and inflammatory responses
